# Glottal Inverse Filtering with LSTMs
Glottal Inverse Filtering (GIF) is a signal processing technique used to estimate the glottal flow waveform from a speech signal. It involves removing the effects of the vocal tract filter to isolate the source signal generated by the vocal folds. 

## Features
- Extracts glottal flow from speech signals.
- Useful for speech analysis, synthesis, and voice pathology studies.
- Can be applied in machine learning models for speech processing.

## Usage
This repository provides tools and models for implementing GIF using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. Refer to the code and examples for detailed usage.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- PyTorch & Torch-Audio
- NumPy

## Dataset
- Training-Dataset: VocalTractLab dataset for connected speech and glottal flow signals
